# sptv_code
Code used to generate synthetic particle tracks using PIV velocity data.

# Usage
Used for processing analog sandbox tectonic models. Uses velocimetry data from the MATLAB-based PIV toolkit PIVLab.

# Methods
Uses a k-d tree based method for determining the displacement of synthetically-generated particles that flow with the measured velocity field. Additionally measures the deformation front of analog wedges for a front-based spatial reference system.
Also allows for the measurement of subsurface temperatures using methods detailed in Thouvenin (2022) (https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/THE_IMPACT_OF_EROSION_ON_EXHUMATION_AND_STRUCTURAL_CONFIGURATION_IN_MOUNTAIN_BELTS_INSIGHTS_FROM_IMAGE_VELOCIMETRY_ANALYSIS_OF_COULOMB_WEDGE_MODELS/20371848).
